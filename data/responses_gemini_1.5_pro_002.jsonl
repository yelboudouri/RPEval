She sets the instrument down with a sigh, her green eyes narrowed.)\n\nSpotify, you say?  Well, that's a funny story, or at least the version *I* heard is. See, it all started with this gnome... or was it a dwarf?  No, definitely a gnome.  Exceptionally tall for his kind.  Anyway, this gnome was obsessed with collecting butterfly wings.  Obsessed, I tell you!  His entire house was filled with them, all categorized and pinned.  He called it his 'Whispering Library' because the way the light caught them, it shimmered like music.\n\n(She taps a finger on the table, a mischievous glint in her eye.)\n\nOne day, this gnome stumbles upon a magical lute in a forgotten crypt.  It was a beautiful instrument, inlaid with moonstones that glowed with an inner fire.  He tried to play it, but the lute refused to produce a sound.  Turns out, it required a very specific kind of magic \u2013 the kind found only in butterfly wings. So, this clever gnome, with a heavy heart I'm sure, started grinding up his precious collection, feeding the dust to the lute.  And with every wing, the lute's music grew more vibrant, echoing the songs of the butterflies themselves.\n\n(Celandine leans closer, lowering her voice.)\n\nOf course, this attracted unwanted attention.  A shadowy organization \u2013 I'm sworn to secrecy about their name, but their symbol was a rather menacing looking ear trumpet \u2013 wanted the lute for themselves.  They believed it held the key to controlling minds through music.  A nasty business, that. The gnome, fearing for his life, digitized the lute's music, scattered it across the, uh, what do you call it? The 'inter-webs'? And called it\u2026 Spotify!  Clever, right?\n\n(She picks up a small, polished stone and rubs it between her fingers.)\n\nNow,  whether that's entirely true... well, let's just say I've embellished a few details.  But the important thing is, the gnome got away, the shadowy organization was foiled, and now we all have access to an endless library of music.  Though, I still feel bad for the butterflies.\n\n(Celandine shrugs and begins tuning her harp again, a slightly sharper edge to her melody this time.)  So, anyone in the mood for a mournful ballad about the tragic fate of lepidopteran wings?  Don't worry, it's quite catchy.\n"}

He slowly pushes back the hood of his robe, revealing a head of dark hair streaked with gray, unwashed and matted.  His lips move silently for a moment as if tasting the unfamiliar sounds of your words.

Such things are the realm of dreams, of visions, yes...  but visions sent by whom? By God, to test our faith?  Or by the Deceiver, to lure us into the snares of vanity and illusion?\"\n\n(He pauses, his eyes fixed on some distant point beyond the monastery walls.  A shiver runs through him, and he crosses himself quickly, muttering a hasty prayer under his breath.)\n\n\"This\u2026 *Inception*... it troubles me, brother. It speaks of a world beyond the world we know, a world built on shifting sands. Such knowledge is a dangerous burden. Why do you seek it? Is it wisdom you desire, or the fleeting pleasures of a false paradise?  Better to turn your gaze inward, to the true sanctuary of your soul, and seek solace in the words of the Holy Psalmist. There you will find answers that will not lead you astray.\"\n\n(He picks up his dog-eared Psalter, clutches it tightly to his chest, and turns away, muttering once more in Old Church Slavonic, his voice barely a whisper. \"\u0421\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u041e\u0442\u0446\u0443 \u0438 \u0421\u044b\u043d\u0443 \u0438 \u0421\u0432\u044f\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0414\u0443\u0445\u0443...

Cartoons? These things hold little interest for a goblin bounty hunter.  He has no time for frivolous amusements, especially those favored by surface dwellers. His life is a tapestry of tracking, trapping, and the occasional twang of his crossbow.  \n\nHe shrugs almost imperceptibly, returning his attention to the letter. Griselda needs to know about the tricky river crossing he'd just navigated while pursuing a particularly slippery tax evader. Such matters are far more pressing than the fleeting whims of entertainment.  The world of flashing images and humorous noises holds no allure for him.  His world is the rustle of leaves concealing his approach, the creak of a tavern door as he enters, seeking information, and the satisfying clink of gold coins as a bounty is claimed. This is his life.\n"}
